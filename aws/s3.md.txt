# S3 Data Layout

This project uses a 3-layer lakehouse layout in S3 to separate raw, cleaned, and analytics outputs.

## Buckets / Paths

### Raw (immutable)
- Purpose: Store source files exactly as received (no edits).
- Path:
  - s3://<your-bucket>/raw/orders/

### Cleaned (standardized Parquet)
- Purpose: Standardize schema + types and convert CSV → Parquet for Athena performance.
- Format: Parquet (Snappy)
- Partition: order_date
- Path:
  - s3://<your-bucket>/cleaned/parquet/orders/

### dbt / Athena staging outputs
- Purpose: Temporary query results and dbt intermediate files.
- Path:
  - s3://<your-bucket>/athena-result/   (Athena workgroup results)
  - s3://<your-bucket>/dbt_staging/     (dbt staging dir)

## Why this layout?
- Raw data remains reproducible and auditable.
- Cleaned layer enables fast Athena queries using Parquet + partition pruning.
- Analytics layer (dbt) remains separate from cleaned to avoid mixing concerns.
