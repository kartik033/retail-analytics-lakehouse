# AWS Glue Crawler Notes

Glue Crawlers are used to register S3 datasets as tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog
so they can be queried from Athena.

## Crawlers

### Raw crawler
- Source:
  - s3://<your-bucket>/raw/
- Output DB:
  - retail_raw
- Purpose:
  - Discover schema of raw CSV files for quick inspection/debugging.

### Cleaned crawler
- Source:
  - s3://<your-bucket>/cleaned/parquet/
- Output DB:
  - retail_cleaned
- Purpose:
  - Register Parquet datasets so Athena can query them efficiently.
  - Detect partitions (order_date).

## Best Practices Used
- Separate databases per layer (raw vs cleaned) to prevent schema conflicts.
- Re-run crawler after structural changes (new folders/partitions/new tables).
